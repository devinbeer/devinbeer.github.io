# Introduction

&nbsp;

Hi, I'm Devin! I'm a Desktop Support Technician @ [Van Andel Research Institute](https://www.vai.org/), based in Grand Rapids, Michigan. I've also graduated from [Baker College](https://www.baker.edu) with a Bachelor's degree in Information Technology & Security. I'm very passionate about digital security and I'm highly motivated to broaden my understanding of how computers, applications, and services connect and interact with each other.
